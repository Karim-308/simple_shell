   Project Overview
  </strong>
</p>

<p align="center">
This project is a custom implementation of a Unix-like shell, developed as a key project in the C programming curriculum at ALX Africa Software Engineering. </br>
It serves as an introductory exploration of advanced concepts such as process management, system calls, bit-level operations, file handling, and error management. </br>
The shell is a simple command interpreter that emulates the basic functionalities of the original Unix shell (sh). </br>
This program is fully developed in the C programming language.

## Project Description:
This shell is developed in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and is inspired by the [Thompson Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_shell).

## Development Environment:

The shell was developed and tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

## Core Features:
* Displays a command prompt and waits for user input. Each command line input ends with a newline.
* If the specified executable is not found, an error message is displayed, and the prompt is shown again.
* Handles errors efficiently.
* Manages the "end of file" condition (Ctrl+D).
* Processes command line arguments.
* Manages the PATH environment variable.
* Supports shell exit commands and exit statuses.
* Ensures the shell does not terminate when Ctrl-C is pressed.
* Supports command separators `;`.
* Handles logical operators `&&` and `||`.
* Manages variable replacements like `$?` and `$$`.
* Recognizes and processes comments with `#`.
* Supports command history.
* Allows input from files.

## Built-in Commands:
Our shell supports the following built-in commands:

| Command             | Functionality                                                                            |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| exit [n]            | Exit the shell, with an optional exit status, n.                                          |
| env                 | Display the environment variables.                                                        |
| setenv [var][value] | Set or update an environment variable.                                                    |
| alias[name[='value]]| Display or define aliases.                                                                |
| unsetenv [var]      | Remove an environment variable.                                                           |
| cd [dir]            | Change the current directory.                                                             |
| help [built-in]     | Display help information for a built-in command.                                          |
